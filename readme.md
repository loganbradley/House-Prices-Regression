This was a group project completed in a graduate regression course. Our goal was to identify which of the 79 variables had an impact on house prices and to examine their effect sizes. In this project, there is:
1. The R code to perform the data cleaning, analysis, and generate the plots.
2. A slide deck that summarizes the main points of the project.
3. The full report complete with all details and discussion of the methodology.
